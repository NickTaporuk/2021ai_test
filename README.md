### Description
    
#### Mode types description
    The Solution can work in 2 mode: a onetime running or as a interactive mode.
    
    To reach out first type of the mode you should run the app in cli with some parameters
    
    Example :
        ./scalc [ SUM [ DIF a.txt b.txt c.txt ] [ INT b.txt c.txt ] ]
        
    To reach out second type of the mode you should run the app in cli without any parameters.
    After that you can work with the app with interactive mode
    Example :
        ./scalc
        
        You should see :
        scalc >
